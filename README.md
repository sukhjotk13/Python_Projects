# Python Projects by Sukhjot Kaur

This repository showcases my Python projects, where I apply various data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Additionally, I tackle complex problems, perform statistical analysis, and create actionable insights to help drive decision-making.

## Projects

- **Algerian Forest Fire Dataset**: Analysis using statistical techniques to explore wildfire data trends.
- **911 Call Data Analysis**: Visualization and insights based on emergency call datasets.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories for more details, including code and analysis.
