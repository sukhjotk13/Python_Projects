# 911 Call Data Analysis

Analyzing 911 emergency call data to uncover trends, optimize resource allocation, and provide insights into emergency response needs across different times and locations.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 50,000 911 emergency calls to identify patterns in call types, locations, and times. Using Python libraries, the dataset was cleaned, visualized, and insights were extracted to assist in understanding call volume trends and peak demand periods, potentially aiding in resource allocation and emergency response optimization.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed and prepared the dataset to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.
- **Data Analysis:** Explored trends in call types, frequency by time, and geographic distribution.
- **Visualization:** Used charts and heatmaps to represent trends, allowing for easy interpretation of data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning and transformation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For data visualization to display trends and patterns.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment to organize and present the analysis.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed null values and handled inconsistent data entries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed call types to determine the most common emergencies.
   - Examined time-based trends to identify peak call periods.
   - Mapped calls by location to visualize geographic trends.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Plotted bar charts and time series graphs for call frequencies.
